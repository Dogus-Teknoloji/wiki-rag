# Task ID: 12
# Title: Optimize Performance and Implement Caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance system performance through optimization techniques and implement caching strategies.
# Details:
1. Implement response caching for query results:
   ```csharp
   services.AddResponseCaching();
   
   app.UseResponseCaching();
   ```

2. Add distributed caching for embeddings:
   ```csharp
   services.AddStackExchangeRedisCache(options => {
     options.Configuration = Configuration.GetConnectionString("Redis");
     options.InstanceName = "WikiRAG:";
   });
   ```

3. Optimize database queries:
   - Add appropriate indexes
   - Implement query optimization
   - Use efficient batch operations

4. Implement connection pooling for database access

5. Add asynchronous processing for non-critical operations

6. Optimize vector similarity search:
   - Implement approximate nearest neighbor search
   - Use indexing strategies for PgVector

7. Set up performance benchmarking and continuous monitoring

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark system performance before and after optimizations
2. Test caching effectiveness with repeated queries
3. Verify distributed caching works correctly
4. Measure database query performance improvements
5. Test system under load to verify optimizations work at scale
6. Verify vector search optimization improves response times
7. Validate system meets all performance requirements (NFR-001 through NFR-004)
