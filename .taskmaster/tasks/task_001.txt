# Description: Initialize the WikiRAG project with .NET Core 9 and configure Docker containerization for the application.
# Details:
1. Create a new .NET Core 9 Web API project
2. Set up project structure with appropriate layers (API, Core, Infrastructure)
3. Configure Docker support with a Dockerfile that includes:
   - .NET Core 9 SDK for building
   - .NET Core 9 runtime for production
   - Multi-stage build for optimization
4. Set up Docker Compose for local development
5. Configure environment variables for different deployment scenarios
6. Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore
7. Create basic health check endpoint at `/api/health`
8. Document setup process in README.md

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify project builds successfully
2. Ensure Docker container builds and runs
3. Validate health check endpoint returns 200 OK
4. Test Docker Compose setup with local development configuration
5. Verify environment variable configuration works across environments
